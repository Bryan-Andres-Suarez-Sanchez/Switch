# Switch Simulation in OMNeT++

This project simulates a basic switch mechanism in a network with four terminals. Each terminal generates a message with a random header, and the switch forwards the message based on its header value to the appropriate terminal.

## Project Structure

- **switch.cc**: This file contains the implementation of the network's terminals and switch.
- **omnetpp.ini**: Configuration file for the simulation.
- **Network Topology**: The network consists of four terminals connected to a central switch. The messages generated by each terminal are routed by the switch based on their header values.

## Terminal Behavior

Each terminal (`Terminal1`, `Terminal2`, `Terminal3`, `Terminal4`) performs the following actions:
1. Generates a message at a random interval.
2. Adds a random header to the message:
   - Headers can be one of the following:
     - **01** (Binary equivalent of 1)
     - **10** (Binary equivalent of 2)
     - **11** (Binary equivalent of 3)
3. Sends the message to the switch.

### Random Header Assignment
Each terminal uses the `generateRandomHeader()` function to assign one of three headers:
- **Terminal 1**: Generates headers 2, 3, or 4.
- **Terminal 2**: Generates headers 1, 3, or 4.
- **Terminal 3**: Generates headers 1, 2, or 4.
- **Terminal 4**: Generates headers 1, 2, or 3.

## Switch Behavior

The switch node reads the header of the incoming message and forwards it to the appropriate terminal using the following rules:
- **Header 1**: Sends the message to Terminal 1.
- **Header 2**: Sends the message to Terminal 2.
- **Header 3**: Sends the message to Terminal 3.
- **Header 4**: Sends the message to Terminal 4.

If the header is invalid, the switch drops the message.

## Running the Simulation

1. Open the project in OMNeT++.
2. Set up the network topology and adjust parameters in `omnetpp.ini` (if needed).
3. Run the simulation to see the message generation and forwarding in action.

## Example Output

In the simulation, you will see the terminals generating messages at different intervals. The switch will route the messages to the correct terminals based on the message headers. Invalid headers will be logged and the messages dropped.

## Future Improvements

- Implement error handling for dropped messages.
- Add support for more terminals and dynamic header assignment.
